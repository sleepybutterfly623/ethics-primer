                                <p>TikTok was launched in 2016 and is the leading destination for short-form 
                                    mobile videos with over one billion active users across over 150 countries. 
                                    Content is aimed to inspire creativity, bring joy, and cultivate a sense of 
                                    community on the platform. Users are able to create and upload short videos 
                                    with a wide range of editing options. They are also able to leverage effects 
                                    and filters. Finally, users are also able to follow content that they like 
                                    and view content in two different frames: the For You Page and the Following Page. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The For You Page is a scrollable feed filled with algorithmic-generated content based on previous interactions on 
                                    the app. This is done using calculations on time spent viewing a video, the number of 
                                    interactions with the video (i.e. sharing it with friends either on the app or on a 
                                    different platform, commenting under a post, liking, or favoriting and saving it to 
                                    watch it again at a later time), and time spent on visiting the creator’s page before 
                                    following. 
                                </p>

                                    The Following Page will show you all posted content in a scrollable feed style from 
                                    creators the user chooses to follow. 
                                </p>

                                    Content on the app is diverse and ranges from cooking to performances and artistic outlets, 
                                    education, beauty, sports, entertainment, and more. And some creators with enough following 
                                    and engagement are able to join the TikTok Creator Fund which supports and rewards creators 
                                    for their contributions to the platform. While the app is free, creators must meet a minimum 
                                    following threshold, accrue the minimum amount of authentic views in the last 30 days, post 
                                    original content in accordance with its Community Guidelines, and meet a specific age requirement. 
                                    After applying and receiving acceptance into the Creator Fund, monetary compensation is calculated 
                                    based on video views and video engagement.

                            Beyond accumulating income through content sharing, TikTok aims to use the platform for social good. 
                            This is done through the promotion of hashtags such as #EduTok which encouraged users to create educational 
                            and motivational content and #ForClimate which was a global campaign partnership with the International 
                            Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to spread climate change awareness.

                        <p>In order to pay their creators, TikTok generates income in the following categories: advertisement, 
                            in-app purchases, and e-commerce offerings.

                                <p>TikTok generates revenue through advertisements for brands that aim to promote their products to a 
                                    broader audience. Brands are able to leverage TikTok’s in-feed advertising, brand takeovers, hashtag 
                                    challenges, and other branded effects.

                                <p>Additionally, TikTok also generates revenue through in-app purchases where customers buy virtual in-app 
                                    coins to be spent on sending gifts to favored content creators. A portion of these in-app coins will be 
                                    translated into commission for the creator and the rest going to TikTok. 
                                </p>

                        <h4>3) E-Commerce Offerings</h4>
                        <p>Finally, the app's income stems from e-commerce offerings where users are able to make purchases within 
                            the app, minimizing the time taken for the user to go to a third-party site and make the purchase elsewhere. 
                            Brands that are connected and involved in e-commerce offerings are able to better capture and maintain the 
                            attention of consumers who were interested in their products.

                    <p>One key component that TikTok implements for the experience of its users is the algorithm. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        TikTok defines its algorithm as “a recommendation system that delivers suggested videos personalized 
                        for each user.” These recommendations depend on the following factors:
                        <ul>
                            <li>User interactions (liking or sharing videos, accounts the user follows, comments made by the user, 
                                and videos created by the user)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Video information (captions, sounds, hashtags, and filter effects)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Device and account settings (language preference, country setting, and device type)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        TikTok takes these factors into consideration and uses a weight and ranking system that determines 
                        which videos the user will be interested in. With these weights, they are able to personalize the For You 
                        feed for their users. However, TikTok also aims to diversify recommendations by including videos that the user may 
                        or may not like so that they can not only enjoy the content they have been seeing but explore new ones.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Because of this algorithmic system, TikTok differentiates itself from its competitors by shaping the experience of users for users. 
                        However, it also raises ethical concerns about potential algorithmic biases that may occur. Users may experience algorithmic bias which 
                        contributes to the cultivation of their own epistemic bubble. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        From a philosophical standpoint, we can further study this under the lenses of published work. The article, " <a href = "https://nissenbaum.tech.cornell.edu/papers/Bias%20in%20Computer%20Systems.pdf" 
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bias in Computer Systems</a> ", by Batya Friedman and Helen Nissenbaum outline three categories of bias in computer systems. Defined as prejudice in favor of 
                        or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way to be unfair, there exists three forms of biases: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Pre-existing bias - reflected biases from individuals and social institutions whose practices and attitudes affect the design of a system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Technical bias - technical constraints or considerations that lead to unfairness.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Emergent bias - the emergence of new knowledge in society that cannot be or wasn't incorporated into the system design. 
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Specifically, with pre-existing bias, this poses the risk of feeding into an epistemic bubble or a social epistemic structure in which other relevant 
                        voices have been left out. C. Thi Nguyen in his work, “<a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/echo-chambers-and-epistemic-bubbles/5D4AC3A808C538E17C50A7C09EC706F0" 
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echo Chambers and Epistemic Bubbles</a>,” outlines primary forces that encourage this type of omission 
                        and cultivates these epistemic bubbles: algorithmic personal filtering and filter bubbles. In both cases, these are technologically mediated methods of 
                        filtering through algorithmic matching or hyper-individualized filters set upon for the user. 
                    </p>

                        And because the TikTok algorithm is tailored to its users, there is a potential hazard that the For You page will contain pre-existing bias since the users'
                         interactions and the environment that they are in serve as inputs for the algorithm to compute videos they are more likely to enjoy.

                        third-party social network providers, and technical and behavioral information about the use of the Platform. Additionally, they collect information contained in 
                        messages sent within the Platform, and if granted permission, they also collect information from the user’s phone book on their mobile device.

                        In addition, TikTok also shares collected information with affiliations of their corporate groups and in connection with substantial corporate transactions 
                        which include the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sales, or bankruptcy. Finally, TikTok discloses information collected for legality processes

                        Despite having an outlined Privacy Policy, we can still draw on philosophical work to determine whether this Privacy Policy is adequate.

                        Judith Jarvis Thomson, argues that the right to privacy is oftentimes ambiguous, especially when it is common to argue that the right to privacy is equivalent to the right to be left undisturbed. 
                        However, Thomson counters this by posing the following scenario in her work, “<a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2265075.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Right to Privacy</a>":

                                The police might say, “We grant we used a special X-ray device on Smith, so as to be able to watch him through the walls of his house; we grant we trained an amplifying device on him so as to be able 
                                to hear everything he said; but we let him strictly alone: we didn’t touch him, we didn’t even go near him – our devices operate at a distance.”

                    <p>
                        And because some information collected by TikTok is done automatically as outlined in their Privacy Policy, is it safe to assume that they are not violating any of their users’ rights to privacy since the 
                        users are undisturbed by this collection? Or is privacy in a digital environment different from a physical sphere?

                        Some have also argued that in this New Digital Sphere, there are three lenses of privacy: information, access, and whether or not the act was intrinsic or instrumental

                        And most recently, the right to privacy has entangled TikTok with the FBI as it becomes an instrumental concern. According to <a href = "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/17/1137155540/fbi-tiktok-national-security-concerns-china"

                    <h2 class = "subheading">Content Moderation and Freedom of Expression
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        As a social media platform, TikTok has content moderation in place to preserve the safety of the online community. To do so, 
                        TikTok invests in human and machine-based moderation to quickly remove harmful content before it reaches the general community. However, 
                        does content moderation infringe upon the freedom of expression and participation in a democratic culture? And how does this affect the 
                        human content moderators behind the scenes? 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Argued by John Stuart Mill, freedom of expression is essential in order for the truth to be revealed. In his publication, <a href = "https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/brown/detail.action?pq-origsite=primo&docID=3420105"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            <i>On Liberty</i></a>, 
                        Mill contends that censorship should be eradicated so that the truth is not suppressed and false information is not perpetuated. By 
                        censoring content or suppressing truths, people are denied the opportunity to exchange truth for error and are unable to fully participate 
                        in the democratic culture. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond information, content moderation and censorship may potentially worsen a user’s experience. For example, Ziggi Tyler, a Black TikTok creator 
                        with more than 370,000 followers, demonstrated that he was unable to include phrases in his account biography that included the word “Black” without being immediately flagged for “inappropriate content.” As part of the machine moderation on TikTok, the app had “mistakenly flagged Tyler’s phrases 
                        because its hate speech detector was triggered by the combination of the words ‘Black’ and ‘audience,’ because the latter contains the word ‘die.’” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tiktok-algorithm-prevents-user-declaring-support-black-lives-matter-n1273413"
                        target="_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>)
                        Likewise, other groups such as Jewish creators have felt that they were subjected to censorship that led to consistent flagging and removal of their content (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/don-t-ban-us-being-jewish-jewish-tiktok-creators-say-n1270598"
                        target="_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of these incidents, and many more, TikTok’s transparency report from February 2021 acknowledges the imperfections of their hate speech detector and 
                        released a statement reaffirming their commitment to rectify it. While their content moderation may be flawed, the work of their moderation processes has preserved 
                        a person’s equal moral standing and prevents the denigration of people on the basis of who they are or aspects of their identity that they are unable to change by 
                        removing apparent hate speech. But this is at the expense of the human moderators. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In March of 2022, Ashley Velez and Reece Young, former TikTok moderators, filed a federal lawsuit and sought class-action status against the company because they 
                        were subjected to emotional trauma and damage caused by “reviewing hundreds of ‘highly toxic and extremely disturbing videos every week,’ including videos of animal 
                        cruelty, torture, and even the execution of children.” According to their suit, Velez and Young were exposed to an unsafe work environment without adequate mental health 
                        treatment that should have been provided by TikTok to cope with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress associated with reviewing graphic videos (<a href = "https://www.npr.org/2022/03/24/1088343332/tiktok-lawsuit-content-moderators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>).

                        But TikTok is not the first. Similar social media platforms such as Facebook were sued in 2020 and had a $52 million settlement to thousands of current and former 
                        moderators who viewed and removed graphic and disturbing posts and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. This gained mass media attention after the article,

                        Like any other social media app, TikTok is only profitable if users stay engaged with the Platform. And in doing so, they capture the attention of their users through 
                        the personalized recommendation feed, curated by a complex algorithm. And compared to other social media platforms, TikTok has been stated to be “skewed against social 
                        connections” (<a href = "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/tiktok-addiction-experts-social-media-craze-app-massive-influence" target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>) since users can scroll for long periods of time without interacting with an individual because of how content-focused the app is. And because of this, studies 
                        have identified TikTok user behaviors to align with an addiction, dubbing it “a TikTok addiction” because of how similar TikTok is to slot machines where its “swipe down” 
                        feature to refresh one’s feed mirrors pulling a slot machine lever. Additionally, there is also the variable pattern of reward: entertaining videos – much like slot machines 
                        which reward players with money. "This pattern keeps individuals engaged under the impression that the next play [or video] might be ‘the one.’”(<a href = "https://sites.brown.edu/publichealthjournal/2021/12/13/tiktok/"

                        </a> by James Williams, Williams argues that current and future generations are at risk of being 
                        heavily influenced by systems of intelligent persuasions that direct thoughts and actions. According to Williams, attention in this digital sphere has become a scarce resource 
                        as technologies are constantly vying to capture and exploit the attention of users and ultimately undermine the integrity of humans at both the individual and collective levels. 
                        To further support his argument, Williams discusses three dimensions of attention:

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Spotlight - a metaphor for one’s immediate attention and representation of one’s focus
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Starlight - a symbol for long-term goals and the choices we make to achieve those goals
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Daylight - an analogy to express how deliberation and reflection are vital to truly understand the desires and needs of oneself
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>With technological apps aiming to steal the “spotlight,” it makes it increasingly more difficult for individuals to remain grounded, maintain an unscattered mind, and cultivate 
                        meaningful interactions with others outside the digital sphere.</p>

                        <p>
                            Despite the nature of the TikTok algorithm, the app has implemented initiatives to avoid stealing its users’ “spotlight.” These include screen time limits which enable the user 
                            to decide how much time they’d like to spend on the app each day. Additionally, there are also videos that pop up within the feed to remind users to take breaks after a certain 
                            amount of uninterrupted screen time. TikTok also published <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/well-being/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital-well being guides</a>, in order to encourage users to take care of themselves.

                <p>Regardless if you are able to or unable to answer those questions, I hope you were able to gain a deeper understanding of philosophical dimensions that can be ethically applied to TikTok but
                    also other technological applications you may engage in!
